# CribEDGE - Pre-alpha

## Explanation
My dad's side of the family holds an annual summer Family Reunion vacation for a whole week. This year, while on vacation, my dad taught me how to play Cribbage. He then mentioned that my grandma (his mother) was the best player he knew.

Challenge: build a Cribbage-playing bot good enough to beat my grandma.

(It doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to work well *enough.*)
